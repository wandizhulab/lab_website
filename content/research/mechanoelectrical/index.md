title: Mechanoelectrical and Electrical Signaling in Thrombosis and Inflammation
date: 2024-09-20
---
We are investigating the role of several mechanosensitive, sensory, voltage-gated ion channels in blood clotting and inflammatory responses. Our goal is to establish these ion channels as potential therapeutic targets for relevant diseases, including thrombosis, cardiovascular disorders and neuroinflammatory diseases.
