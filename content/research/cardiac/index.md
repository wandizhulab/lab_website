We are developing new experimental and computational methods to spatially map gene transcription and electrical activities across the heart. We aim to understand how the interplay between these processes governs heart development and contributes to arrhythmogenic diseases. We are also interested in understanding how metabolic regulators alter these mechanisms in diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
