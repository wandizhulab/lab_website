abstract: Functional eukaryotic voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) channels comprise four domains
  (DI–DIV), each containing six membrane-spanning segments (S1–S6). Voltage sensing
  is accomplished by the first four membrane-spanning segments (S1–S4), which together
  form a voltage-sensing domain (VSD). A critical NaV channel gating process, inactivation,
  has previously been linked to activation of the VSDs in DIII and DIV. Here, we probe
  this interaction by using voltage-clamp fluorometry to observe VSD kinetics in the
  presence of mutations at locations that have been shown to impair NaV channel inactivation.
  These locations include the DIII–DIV linker, the DIII S4–S5 linker, and the DIV
  S4-S5 linker. Our results show that, within the 10-ms timeframe of fast inactivation,
  the DIV-VSD is the primary regulator of inactivation. However, after longer 100-ms
  pulses, the DIII–DIV linker slows DIII-VSD deactivation, and the rate of DIII deactivation
  correlates strongly with the rate of recovery from inactivation. Our results imply
  that, over the course of an action potential, DIV-VSDs regulate the onset of fast
  inactivation while DIII-VSDs determine its recovery.
