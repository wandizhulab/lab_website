abstract: Hematopoietic cell selection based on PIEZO1 expression drives thrombosis
  risk in type 2 diabetes. Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of thrombosis.
  Zhu et al. show that the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1 is dysregulated in
  hematopoietic lineage cells during hyperglycemia. The increased PIEZO1 triggered
  flow-dependent prothrombotic responses in platelets, RBCs, and neutrophils in peripheral
  blood samples from patients with diabetes. Pharmacological inhibition of the channel
  conversely protected against clot formation in the patient blood samples and in
  a hyperglycemic zebrafish model. This work demonstrates that PIEZO1 drives a mechanothrombotic
  pathway in diabetes and identifies possible therapeutic strategies for follow-up
  study. Thrombosis is the leading complication of common human disorders including
  diabetes, coronary heart disease, and infection and remains a global health burden.
  Current anticoagulant therapies that target the general clotting cascade are associated
  with unpredictable adverse bleeding effects, because understanding of hemostasis
  remains incomplete. Here, using perturbational screening of patient peripheral blood
  samples for latent phenotypes, we identified dysregulation of the major mechanosensory
  ion channel Piezo1 in multiple blood lineages in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
  (T2DM). Hyperglycemia activated PIEZO1 transcription in mature blood cells and selected
  high Piezo1â€“expressing hematopoietic stem cell clones. Elevated Piezo1 activity
  in platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in T2DM triggered discrete prothrombotic
  cellular responses. Inhibition of Piezo1 protected against thrombosis both in human
  blood and in zebrafish genetic models, particularly in hyperglycemia. Our findings
  identify a candidate target to precisely modulate mechanically induced thrombosis
  in T2DM and a potential screening method to predict patient-specific risk. Ongoing
  remodeling of cell lineages in hematopoiesis is an integral component of thrombotic
  risk in T2DM, and related mechanisms may have a broader role in chronic disease.
