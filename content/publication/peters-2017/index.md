  mutant in the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel Na V 1.5. E1784K shifts the midpoint
  of the channel conductance-voltage relationship to more depolarized membrane potentials
  and accelerates the rate of channel fast inactivation. The depolarizing shift in
  the midpoint of the conductance curve in E1784K is exacerbated by low extracellular
  pH. We tested whether the E1784K mutant shifts the channel conductance curve to
  more depolarized membrane potentials by affecting the channel voltage-sensors. We
  measured ionic currents and gating currents at pH 7.4 and pH 6.0 in Xenopus laevis
  oocytes. Contrary to our expectation, the movement of gating charges is shifted
  to more hyperpolarized membrane potentials by E1784K. Voltage-clamp fluorimetry
  experiments show that this gating charge shift is due to the movement of the DIVS4
  voltage-sensor being shifted to more hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Using a
  model and experiments on fast inactivation-deficient channels, we show that changes
  to the rate and voltage-dependence of fast inactivation are sufficient to shift
  the conductance curve in E1784K. Our results localize the effects of E1784K to DIVS4,
  and provide novel insight into the role of the DIV-VSD in regulating the voltage-dependencies
  of activation and fast inactivation.
