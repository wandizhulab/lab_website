abstract: Antiarrhythmic treatment strategies remain suboptimal due to our inability
  to predict how drug interactions with ion channels will affect the ability of the
  tissues to initiate and sustain an arrhythmia. We built a multiscale molecular model
  of the Na+ channel domain III (domain III voltage-sensing domain) to highlight the
  molecular underpinnings responsible for mexiletine drug efficacy. This model predicts
  that a hyperpolarizing shift in the domain III voltage-sensing domain is critical
  for drug efficacy and may be leveraged to design more potent Class I molecules.
  The model was therefore used to design, in silico, a theoretical mexiletine booster
  that can dramatically rescue a mutant resistant to the potent antiarrhythmic effects
  of mexiletine. Our framework provides a strategy for in silico design of precision-targeted
  therapeutic agents that simultaneously assesses antiarrhythmic markers of success
  and failure at multiple spatial and time scales. This approach provides a roadmap
  for the design of novel molecular-based therapy to treat myriad arrhythmia syndromes,
  including ventricular tachycardia, heart failure arrhythmias, and inherited arrhythmia
  syndromes.
