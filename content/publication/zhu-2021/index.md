abstract: Native myocardial voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels function in macromolecular
  complexes comprising a pore-forming (α) subunit and multiple accessory proteins.
  Here, we investigated the impact of accessory NaVβ1 and NaVβ3 subunits on the functional
  effects of 2 well-known class Ib antiarrhythmics, lidocaine and ranolazine, on the
  predominant NaV channel α subunit, NaV1.5, expressed in the mammalian heart. We
  showed that both drugs stabilized the activated conformation of the voltage sensor
  of domain-III (DIII-VSD) in NaV1.5. In the presence of NaVβ1, the effect of lidocaine
  on the DIII-VSD was enhanced, whereas the effect of ranolazine was abolished. Mutating
  the main class Ib drug-binding site, F1760, affected but did not abolish the modulation
  of drug block by NaVβ1/β3. Recordings from adult mouse ventricular myocytes demonstrated
  that loss of Scn1b (NaVβ1) differentially affected the potencies of lidocaine and
  ranolazine. In vivo experiments revealed distinct ECG responses to i.p. injection
  of ranolazine or lidocaine in WT and Scn1b-null animals, suggesting that NaVβ1 modulated
  drug responses at the whole-heart level. In the human heart, we found that SCN1B
  transcript expression was 3 times higher in the atria than ventricles, differences
  that could, in combination with inherited or acquired cardiovascular disease, dramatically
  affect patient response to class Ib antiarrhythmic therapies.
