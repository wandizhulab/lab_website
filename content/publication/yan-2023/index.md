abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and
  mortality, imposing an increasing global health burden. Cardiac ion channels (voltage-gated
  NaV, CaV, KVs, and others) synergistically shape the cardiac action potential (AP)
  and control the heartbeat. Dysfunction of these channels, due to genetic mutations,
  transcriptional or post-translational modifications, may disturb the AP and lead
  to arrhythmia, a major risk for CVD patients. Although there are five classes of
  anti-arrhythmic drugs available, they can have varying levels of efficacies and
  side effects on patients, possibly due to the complex pathogenesis of arrhythmias.
  As an alternative treatment option, Chinese herbal remedies have shown promise in
  regulating cardiac ion channels and providing anti-arrhythmic effects. In this review,
  we first discuss the role of cardiac ion channels in maintaining normal heart function
  and the pathogenesis of CVD, then summarize the classification of Chinese herbal
  compounds, and elaborate detailed mechanisms of their efficacy in regulating cardiac
  ion channels and in alleviating arrhythmia and CVD. We also address current limitations
  and opportunities for developing new anti-CVD drugs based on Chinese herbal medicines.
