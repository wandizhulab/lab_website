abstract: 'The auxiliary β3-subunit is an important functional regulator of the cardiac
  sodium channel Nav1.5, and some β3 mutations predispose individuals to cardiac arrhythmias.
  The β3-subunit uses its transmembrane α-helix and extracellular domain to bind to
  Nav1.5. Here, we investigated the role of an unusually located and highly conserved
  glutamic acid (Glu-176) within the β3 transmembrane region and its potential for
  functionally synergizing with the β3 extracellular domain (ECD).  We substituted
  Glu-176 with lysine (E176K) in the wildtype β3-subunit and in a β3-subunit lacking
  the ECD. Patch-clamp experiments indicated that the E176K substitution does not
  affect the previously observed β3-dependent depolarizing shift of V1/2 of steady-state
  inactivation but does attenuate the accelerated recovery from inactivation conferred
  by the wild-type β3-subunit. Removal of the β3-ECD abrogated both the depolarizing
  shift of steady-state inactivation and the accelerated recovery, irrespective of
  the presence or absence of the Glu-176 residue. We found that steady-state inactivation
  and recovery from inactivation involve movements of the S4 helices within the DIII
  and DIV voltage sensors in response to membrane potential changes. Voltage-clamp
  fluorometry revealed that the E176K substitution alters DIII voltage sensor dynamics
  without affecting DIV. In contrast, removal of the ECD significantly altered the
  dynamics of both DIII and DIV. These results imply distinct roles for the β3–Glu-176
  residue and the β3-ECD in regulating the conformational changes of the voltage sensors
  that determine channel inactivation and recovery from inactivation. '
