abstract: Background Inherited autosomal dominant mutations in cardiac sodium channels
  (NaV1.5) cause various arrhythmias, such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome.
  Although dozens of mutations throughout the protein have been reported, there are
  few reported mutations within a voltage sensor S4 transmembrane segment and few
  that are homozygous. Here we report analysis of a novel lidocaine-sensitive recessive
  mutation, p.R1309H, in the NaV1.5 DIII/S4 voltage sensor in a patient with a complex
  arrhythmia syndrome. Methods and results We expressed the wild type or mutant NaV1.5
  heterologously for analysis with the patch-clamp and voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF)
  techniques. p.R1309H depolarized the voltage-dependence of activation, hyperpolarized
  the voltage-dependence of inactivation, and slowed recovery from inactivation, thereby
  reducing the channel availability at physiologic membrane potentials. Additionally,
  p.R1309H increased the “late” Na+ current. The location of the mutation in DIIIS4
  prompted testing for a gating pore current. We observed an inward current at hyperpolarizing
  voltages that likely exacerbates the loss-of-function defects at resting membrane
  potentials. Lidocaine reduced the gating pore current. Conclusions The p.R1309H
  homozygous NaV1.5 mutation conferred both gain-of-function and loss-of-function
  effects on NaV1.5 channel activity. Reduction of a mutation-induced gating pore
  current by lidocaine suggested a therapeutic mechanism.
