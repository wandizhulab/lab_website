abstract: 'Rationale: Mutations in the SCN5A gene, encoding the α subunit of the Nav1.5
  channel, cause a life-threatening form of cardiac arrhythmia, Long QT Syndrome Type
  3 (LQT3). Mexiletine, which is structurally related to the Na+channel-blocking anesthetic
  lidocaine, is used to treat LQT3 patients. However, the patient response is variable,
  depending on the genetic mutation in SCN5A. Objective: The goal of this study is
  to understand the molecular basis of patients’ variable responses and build a predictive
  statistical model that can be utilized to personalize mexiletine treatment based
  on patient’s genetic variant. Methods and Results: We monitored the cardiac Na+channel
  voltage-sensing domain (VSD) conformational dynamics simultaneously with other gating
  properties for the LQT3 variants. To systematically identify the relationship between
  mexiletine block and channel biophysical properties, we used a system-based statistical
  modeling approach to connect the multivariate properties to patient phenotype. We
  found that mexiletine altered the conformation of the Domain-III VSD (DIII-VSD),
  which is the same VSD that many tested LQT3 mutations affect. Analysis of 15 LQT3
  variants showed a strong correlation between the activation of the DIII-VSD and
  the strength of the inhibition of the channel by mexiletine. Based on this improved
  molecular-level understanding, we generated a systems-based model based on a dataset
  of 32 LQT3 patients, which then successfully predicted the response of 7 out of
  8 patients to mexiletine in a blinded, retrospective trial. Conclusions: Our results
  imply that the modulated receptor theory of local anesthetic action, which confines
  local anesthetic binding effects to the channel pore, should be revised to include
  drug interaction with the DIII-VSD. Using an algorithm that incorporates this mode
  of action, we can predict patient-specific responses to mexiletine, improving therapeutic
  decision making.'
