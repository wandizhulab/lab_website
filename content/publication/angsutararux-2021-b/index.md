abstract: Voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) channels underlie the initiation and propagation
  of action potentials (APs). Rapid inactivation after NaV channel opening, known
  as open-state inactivation, plays a critical role in limiting the AP duration. However,
  NaV channel inactivation can also occur before opening, namely closed-state inactivation,
  to tune the cellular excitability. The voltage-sensing domain (VSD) within repeat
  IV (VSD-IV) of the pseudotetrameric NaV channel Î±-subunit is known to be a critical
  regulator of NaV channel inactivation. Yet, the two processes of open- and closed-state
  inactivation predominate at different voltage ranges and feature distinct kinetics.
  How inactivation occurs over these different ranges to give rise to the complexity
  of NaV channel dynamics is unclear. Past functional studies and recent cryo-electron
  microscopy structures, however, reveal significant inactivation regulation from
  other NaV channel components. In this Hypothesis paper, we propose that the VSD
  of NaV repeat III (VSD-III), together with VSD-IV, orchestrates the inactivation-state
  occupancy of NaV channels by modulating the affinity of the intracellular binding
  site of the IFMT motif on the III-IV linker. We review and outline substantial evidence
  that VSD-III activates in two distinct steps, with the intermediate and fully activated
  conformation regulating closed- and open-state inactivation state occupancy by altering
  the formation and affinity of the IFMT crevice. A role of VSD-III in determining
  inactivation-state occupancy and recovery from inactivation suggests a regulatory
  mechanism for the state-dependent block by small-molecule anti-arrhythmic and anesthetic
  therapies.
