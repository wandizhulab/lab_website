abstract: Voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) channels regulate homeostasis in bacteria and control
  membrane electrical excitability in mammals. Compared to their mammalian counterparts,
  bacterial NaV channels possess a simpler, fourfold symmetric structure and have
  facilitated studies of the structural basis of channel gating. However, the pharmacology
  of bacterial NaV remains largely unexplored. Here we systematically screened 39
  NaV modulators on a bacterial channel (NaChBac) and characterized a selection of
  compounds on NaChBac and a mammalian channel (human NaV1.7). We found that while
  many compounds interact with both channels, they exhibit distinct functional effects.
  For example, the local anesthetics ambroxol and lidocaine block both NaV1.7 and
  NaChBac but affect activation and inactivation of the two channels to different
  extents. The voltage-sensing domain targeting toxin BDS-I increases NaV1.7 but decreases
  NaChBac peak currents. The pore binding toxins aconitine and veratridine block peak
  currents of NaV1.7 and shift activation (aconitine) and inactivation (veratridine)
  respectively. In NaChBac, they block the peak current by binding to the pore residue
  F224. Nonetheless, aconitine has no effect on activation or inactivation, while
  veratridine only modulates activation of NaChBac. The conservation and divergence
  in the pharmacology of bacterial and mammalian NaV channels provide insights into
  the molecular basis of channel gating and will facilitate organism-specific drug
  discovery.
