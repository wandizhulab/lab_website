Wandi’s group studies electrical and mechanoelectrical signaling in both excitable and non-excitable cell types to uncover their impact on health and disease. Before joining OSU, Wandi was an Instructor at Harvard Medical School and an Investigator at Brigham and Women's Hospital. She earned her Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Washington University in St. Louis, where her thesis, mentored by Dr. Jonathan Silva, examined the impact of genetic variants and NaV channel accessory subunits on Class-Ib drug interactions with the cardiac NaV channel. After a brief work experience at Genentech, Inc., where she worked in Dr. Jun Chen’s group on high-throughput electrophysiology, Wandi pursued postdoctoral training in Dr. Calum MacRae’s lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. There, she developed human blood phenotyping platforms to identify genetically determined latent blood traits, which can be used to stratify risks for various common complex diseases.
