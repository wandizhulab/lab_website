   abstract = {Functional eukaryotic voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) channels comprise four domains (DI–DIV), each containing six membrane-spanning segments (S1–S6). Voltage sensing is accomplished by the first four membrane-spanning segments (S1–S4), which together form a voltage-sensing domain (VSD). A critical NaV channel gating process, inactivation, has previously been linked to activation of the VSDs in DIII and DIV. Here, we probe this interaction by using voltage-clamp fluorometry to observe VSD kinetics in the presence of mutations at locations that have been shown to impair NaV channel inactivation. These locations include the DIII–DIV linker, the DIII S4–S5 linker, and the DIV S4-S5 linker. Our results show that, within the 10-ms timeframe of fast inactivation, the DIV-VSD is the primary regulator of inactivation. However, after longer 100-ms pulses, the DIII–DIV linker slows DIII-VSD deactivation, and the rate of DIII deactivation correlates strongly with the rate of recovery from inactivation. Our results imply that, over the course of an action potential, DIV-VSDs regulate the onset of fast inactivation while DIII-VSDs determine its recovery.},

   abstract = {Voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) channels comprise a macromolecular complex whose components tailor channel function. Key components are the non-covalently bound β1 and β3 subunits that regulate channel gating, expression, and pharmacology. Here, we probe the molecular basis of this regulation by applying voltage clamp fluorometry to measure how the β subunits affect the conformational dynamics of the cardiac NaV channel (NaV1.5) voltage-sensing domains (VSDs). The pore-forming NaV1.5 α subunit contains four domains (DI–DIV), each with a VSD. Our results show that β1 regulates NaV1.5 by modulating the DIV-VSD, whereas β3 alters channel kinetics mainly through DIII-VSD interaction. Introduction of a quenching tryptophan into the extracellular region of the β3 transmembrane segment inverted the DIII-VSD fluorescence. Additionally, a fluorophore tethered to β3 at the same position produced voltage-dependent fluorescence dynamics strongly resembling those of the DIII-VSD. Together, these results provide compelling evidence that β3 binds proximally to the DIII-VSD. Molecular-level differences in β1 and β3 interaction with the α subunit lead to distinct activation and inactivation recovery kinetics, significantly affecting NaV channel regulation of cell excitability.},

E1784K is the most common mixed long QT syndrome/Brugada syndrome mutant in the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel Na V 1.5. E1784K shifts the midpoint of the channel conductance-voltage relationship to more depolarized membrane potentials and accelerates the rate of channel fast inactivation. The depolarizing shift in the midpoint of the conductance curve in E1784K is exacerbated by low extracellular pH. We tested whether the E1784K mutant shifts the channel conductance curve to more depolarized membrane potentials by affecting the channel voltage-sensors. We measured ionic currents and gating currents at pH 7.4 and pH 6.0 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Contrary to our expectation, the movement of gating charges is shifted to more hyperpolarized membrane potentials by E1784K. Voltage-clamp fluorimetry experiments show that this gating charge shift is due to the movement of the DIVS4 voltage-sensor being shifted to more hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Using a model and experiments on fast inactivation-deficient channels, we show that changes to the rate and voltage-dependence of fast inactivation are sufficient to shift the conductance curve in E1784K. Our results localize the effects of E1784K to DIVS4, and provide novel insight into the role of the DIV-VSD in regulating the voltage-dependencies of activation and fast inactivation.},

We built a multiscale molecular model of the Na+ channel domain III (domain III voltage-sensing domain) to highlight the molecular underpinnings responsible for mexiletine drug efficacy. This model predicts that a hyperpolarizing shift in the domain III voltage-sensing domain is critical for drug efficacy and may be leveraged to design more potent Class I molecules. The model was therefore used to design, in silico, a theoretical mexiletine booster that can dramatically rescue a mutant resistant to the potent antiarrhythmic effects of mexiletine. Our framework provides a strategy for in silico design of precision-targeted therapeutic agents that simultaneously assesses antiarrhythmic markers of success and failure at multiple spatial and time scales. This approach provides a roadmap for the design of novel molecular-based therapy to treat myriad arrhythmia syndromes, including ventricular tachycardia, heart failure arrhythmias, and inherited arrhythmia syndromes.},

   abstract = {Rationale: Mutations in the SCN5A gene, encoding the α subunit of the Nav1.5 channel, cause a life-threatening form of cardiac arrhythmia, Long QT Syndrome Type 3 (LQT3). Mexiletine, which is structurally related to the Na+channel-blocking anesthetic lidocaine, is used to treat LQT3 patients. However, the patient response is variable, depending on the genetic mutation in SCN5A. Objective: The goal of this study is to understand the molecular basis of patients’ variable responses and build a predictive statistical model that can be utilized to personalize mexiletine treatment based on patient’s genetic variant. Methods and Results: We monitored the cardiac Na+channel voltage-sensing domain (VSD) conformational dynamics simultaneously with other gating properties for the LQT3 variants. To systematically identify the relationship between mexiletine block and channel biophysical properties, we used a system-based statistical modeling approach to connect the multivariate properties to patient phenotype. We found that mexiletine altered the conformation of the Domain-III VSD (DIII-VSD), which is the same VSD that many tested LQT3 mutations affect. Analysis of 15 LQT3 variants showed a strong correlation between the activation of the DIII-VSD and the strength of the inhibition of the channel by mexiletine. Based on this improved molecular-level understanding, we generated a systems-based model based on a dataset of 32 LQT3 patients, which then successfully predicted the response of 7 out of 8 patients to mexiletine in a blinded, retrospective trial. Conclusions: Our results imply that the modulated receptor theory of local anesthetic action, which confines local anesthetic binding effects to the channel pore, should be revised to include drug interaction with the DIII-VSD. Using an algorithm that incorporates this mode of action, we can predict patient-specific responses to mexiletine, improving therapeutic decision making.},

   abstract = {The auxiliary β3-subunit is an important functional regulator of the cardiac sodium channel Nav1.5, and some β3 mutations predispose individuals to cardiac arrhythmias. The β3-subunit uses its transmembrane α-helix and extracellular domain to bind to Nav1.5. Here, we investigated the role of an unusually located and highly conserved glutamic acid (Glu-176) within the β3 transmembrane region and its potential for functionally synergizing with the β3 extracellular domain (ECD).  We substituted Glu-176 with lysine (E176K) in the wildtype β3-subunit and in a β3-subunit lacking the ECD. Patch-clamp experiments indicated that the E176K substitution does not affect the previously observed β3-dependent depolarizing shift of V1/2 of steady-state inactivation but does attenuate the accelerated recovery from inactivation conferred by the wild-type β3-subunit. Removal of the β3-ECD abrogated both the depolarizing shift of steady-state inactivation and the accelerated recovery, irrespective of the presence or absence of the Glu-176 residue. We found that steady-state inactivation and recovery from inactivation involve movements of the S4 helices within the DIII and DIV voltage sensors in response to membrane potential changes. Voltage-clamp fluorometry revealed that the E176K substitution alters DIII voltage sensor dynamics without affecting DIV. In contrast, removal of the ECD significantly altered the dynamics of both DIII and DIV. These results imply distinct roles for the β3–Glu-176 residue and the β3-ECD in regulating the conformational changes of the voltage sensors that determine channel inactivation and recovery from inactivation. },

   abstract = {Voltage-gated Na+ (NaV) channels regulate homeostasis in bacteria and control membrane electrical excitability in mammals. Compared to their mammalian counterparts, bacterial NaV channels possess a simpler, fourfold symmetric structure and have facilitated studies of the structural basis of channel gating. However, the pharmacology of bacterial NaV remains largely unexplored. Here we systematically screened 39 NaV modulators on a bacterial channel (NaChBac) and characterized a selection of compounds on NaChBac and a mammalian channel (human NaV1.7). We found that while many compounds interact with both channels, they exhibit distinct functional effects. For example, the local anesthetics ambroxol and lidocaine block both NaV1.7 and NaChBac but affect activation and inactivation of the two channels to different extents. The voltage-sensing domain targeting toxin BDS-I increases NaV1.7 but decreases NaChBac peak currents. The pore binding toxins aconitine and veratridine block peak currents of NaV1.7 and shift activation (aconitine) and inactivation (veratridine) respectively. In NaChBac, they block the peak current by binding to the pore residue F224. Nonetheless, aconitine has no effect on activation or inactivation, while veratridine only modulates activation of NaChBac. The conservation and divergence in the pharmacology of bacterial and mammalian NaV channels provide insights into the molecular basis of channel gating and will facilitate organism-specific drug discovery.},

We showed that both drugs stabilized the activated conformation of the voltage sensor of domain-III (DIII-VSD) in NaV1.5. In the presence of NaVβ1, the effect of lidocaine on the DIII-VSD was enhanced, whereas the effect of ranolazine was abolished.

Recordings from adult mouse ventricular myocytes demonstrated that loss of Scn1b (NaVβ1) differentially affected the potencies of lidocaine and ranolazine. In vivo experiments revealed distinct ECG responses to i.p. injection of ranolazine or lidocaine in WT and Scn1b-null animals, suggesting that NaVβ1 modulated drug responses at the whole-heart level. In the human heart, we found that SCN1B transcript expression was 3 times higher in the atria than ventricles, differences that could, in combination with inherited or acquired cardiovascular disease, dramatically affect patient response to class Ib antiarrhythmic therapies.},

Multiple stresses induce changes in V1-Vo assembly, but the signaling mechanisms behind these changes are not understood. Here we show that certain stress-responsive changes in V-ATPase activity and assembly require the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PI(3,5)P2). V-ATPase activation through V1-Vo assembly in response to salt stress is strongly dependent on PI(3,5)P2 synthesis. Purified Vo complexes preferentially bind to PI(3,5)P2 on lipid arrays, suggesting direct binding between the lipid and the membrane sector of the V-ATPase. Increasing PI(3,5)P2 levels in vivo recruits the N-terminal domain of Vo-sector subunit Vph1p from cytosol to membranes, independent of other subunits. This Vph1p domain is critical for V1-Vo interaction, suggesting that interaction of Vph1p with PI(3,5)P2-containing membranes stabilizes V1-Vo assembly and thus increases V-ATPase activity. These results help explain the previously described vacuolar acidification defect in yeast fab1? and vac14? mutants and suggest that human disease phenotypes associated with PI(3,5)P2 loss may arise from compromised V-ATPase stability and regulation.},

   abstract = {Background
Inherited autosomal dominant mutations in cardiac sodium channels (NaV1.5) cause various arrhythmias, such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome. Although dozens of mutations throughout the protein have been reported, there are few reported mutations within a voltage sensor S4 transmembrane segment and few that are homozygous. Here we report analysis of a novel lidocaine-sensitive recessive mutation, p.R1309H, in the NaV1.5 DIII/S4 voltage sensor in a patient with a complex arrhythmia syndrome.
Methods and results
We expressed the wild type or mutant NaV1.5 heterologously for analysis with the patch-clamp and voltage clamp fluorometry (VCF) techniques. p.R1309H depolarized the voltage-dependence of activation, hyperpolarized the voltage-dependence of inactivation, and slowed recovery from inactivation, thereby reducing the channel availability at physiologic membrane potentials. Additionally, p.R1309H increased the “late” Na+ current. The location of the mutation in DIIIS4 prompted testing for a gating pore current. We observed an inward current at hyperpolarizing voltages that likely exacerbates the loss-of-function defects at resting membrane potentials. Lidocaine reduced the gating pore current.
Conclusions
The p.R1309H homozygous NaV1.5 mutation conferred both gain-of-function and loss-of-function effects on NaV1.5 channel activity. Reduction of a mutation-induced gating pore current by lidocaine suggested a therapeutic mechanism.},

Using CRISPR, we established a mutant with the orthologous hoxbb cluster deletion in zebrafish. The mutant exhibited heart failure and atrioventricular regurgitation at 5 days. Analyzing the four genes in the hoxbb cluster, isolated deletion of hoxb1b−/− recapitulated the cardiac abnormalities, supporting hoxb1b as the causal gene. Both  in situ and in vitro data indicated that hoxb1b regulates gata5 to inhibit hand2 expression and ultimately is required to pattern the vertebrate atrioventricular boundary. Together, these data reveal a role for segmental specification in vertebrate cardiac development and highlight the utility of CRISPR techniques for efficiently exploring the function of large structural genomic lesions.},

   abstract = {Hematopoietic cell selection based on PIEZO1 expression drives thrombosis risk in type 2 diabetes. Patients with diabetes are at increased risk of thrombosis. Zhu et al. show that the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1 is dysregulated in hematopoietic lineage cells during hyperglycemia. The increased PIEZO1 triggered flow-dependent prothrombotic responses in platelets, RBCs, and neutrophils in peripheral blood samples from patients with diabetes. Pharmacological inhibition of the channel conversely protected against clot formation in the patient blood samples and in a hyperglycemic zebrafish model. This work demonstrates that PIEZO1 drives a mechanothrombotic pathway in diabetes and identifies possible therapeutic strategies for follow-up study. Thrombosis is the leading complication of common human disorders including diabetes, coronary heart disease, and infection and remains a global health burden. Current anticoagulant therapies that target the general clotting cascade are associated with unpredictable adverse bleeding effects, because understanding of hemostasis remains incomplete. Here, using perturbational screening of patient peripheral blood samples for latent phenotypes, we identified dysregulation of the major mechanosensory ion channel Piezo1 in multiple blood lineages in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hyperglycemia activated PIEZO1 transcription in mature blood cells and selected high Piezo1–expressing hematopoietic stem cell clones. Elevated Piezo1 activity in platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils in T2DM triggered discrete prothrombotic cellular responses. Inhibition of Piezo1 protected against thrombosis both in human blood and in zebrafish genetic models, particularly in hyperglycemia. Our findings identify a candidate target to precisely modulate mechanically induced thrombosis in T2DM and a potential screening method to predict patient-specific risk. Ongoing remodeling of cell lineages in hematopoiesis is an integral component of thrombotic risk in T2DM, and related mechanisms may have a broader role in chronic disease.},
